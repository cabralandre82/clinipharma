# Claims Audit — the evidence loop

**Owner:** solo operator + AI agents
**Cadence:** weekly (Tuesday 06:00 UTC via `.github/workflows/claims-audit.yml`)
**SLA:** weekly review; any `fail` must be resolved before the next run.

## Why this exists

Every skill, rule, runbook and invariant in this repo makes claims about
the platform — "audit chain is intact", "all 19 crons exist", "money is
always cents/bigint", "every skill crosslinks its runbook", "every
referenced feature flag is migrated".

Claims rot silently. Someone removes a cron from `vercel.json` but leaves
the runbook; a skill links to a file that was renamed; an invariant
documents a behaviour that was reverted. Each break makes the agent
answer wrong next time it's asked.

The claims audit is the **evidence loop** for this trust problem: a
weekly job that _verifies_ every plausible claim the docs make against
the actual codebase and fails loud when a claim becomes a lie.

## What it verifies (today)

Ten verifiers under `scripts/claims/`:

| Verifier                      | Claim being verified                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |

| `check-skill-structure`       | Every `.cursor/skills/*/SKILL.md` has valid frontmatter + trigger phrase.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| `check-cross-links`           | Every link from skills/rules/runbooks/AGENTS.md resolves to a real file.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| `check-cron-claims`           | Every `/api/cron/X` mentioned in docs exists in `vercel.json` + as route.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| `check-feature-flags`         | Every `feature_flags` key referenced in docs has a migration defining it.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| `check-invariants`            | AGENTS.md invariants hold — see expanded matrix below.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| `check-metric-emission`       | Every metric name backtick-cited in a runbook/skill/rule/AGENTS.md is actually emitted by the codebase.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| `check-skill-trigger-overlap` | No two skills' descriptions share a normalized trigger phrase — dispatch must be a disjoint partition.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| `check-rls-policy-coverage`   | Every table in `public` has either ≥ 1 `CREATE POLICY` or an explicit `-- @rls-policy(table_name): <justification>` marker. Protects against "deny-all by silence" drift.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| `check-env-documented`        | Every `process.env.X` read by production paths (`app/`, `lib/`, `middleware.ts`, `next.config.ts`, `components/`, `services/`) is templated in `.env.example` or annotated with `# @env-exempt: X — reason`. Protects onboarding + deploys from "app boots then silently degrades on missing env" foot-guns.                                                                                                                             |
| `check-retention-policies`    | Every entry in `lib/retention/policies.ts` (catalog + `RETENTION_EXCLUDED_TABLES`) points at a real `CREATE TABLE public.X`; every cron named by a policy exists as a route; every retention-adjacent cron (`purge-*`, `enforce-retention`) is named by ≥ 1 policy (reverse direction); each cron actually references its target table in code. Protects the ANPD-grade claim that the retention doc describes the system we're running. |

Each verifier emits JSON to `scripts/claims/.results/<name>.json`:

```json
{
  "name": "cron-claims",
  "passed": 9,
  "failed": 0,
  "warnings": 10,
  "findings": [
    {
      "severity": "warn",
      "claim": "declared cron is documented",
      "detail": "/api/cron/churn-check in vercel.json but not referenced in any runbook/skill",
      "location": "vercel.json"
    }
  ]
}
```

`run-all.sh` aggregates them into a Markdown summary published to the
GitHub Actions step summary + attached as artifact (90-day retention).

### Invariants matrix (what `check-invariants.sh` enforces)

The invariants verifier encodes every AGENTS.md rule we can falsify in
code. Each check below is **"claim broken → this script flags it"**.

| Invariant                                               | Severity on break | How it's detected                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |

## Severity philosophy

- **`fail`** — the claim is currently a lie (e.g. referenced cron doesn't exist, `poweredByHeader: false` is missing). Breaks CI. Fix before merging.
- **`warn`** — drift signal, not a broken invariant. Referenced doc missing (stub never written), flag defined but nobody mentions it, cron configured but undocumented. Tracked via weekly issue; triage at leisure.
- **`pass`** — claim held this run. Counted for trend visibility.

Failing the job outright on any warning would create alert fatigue — you'd silence the audit. Warnings are accumulated into a single tracking issue opened weekly so triage is a ritual, not an interrupt.

## Output

### Per-run artefacts (`scripts/claims/.results/`)

- `summary.md` — human-readable Markdown with per-verifier counts + findings
- `<verifier>.json` — machine-readable detail for each check

### CI integration

- **PR events** (on changes to scanned paths): the audit runs, any `fail` blocks merge, the Markdown summary is posted to the Actions summary tab.
- **Weekly cron** (Tuesday 06:00 UTC): opens/updates a GitHub issue labelled `claims-audit`, `operations`, `solo-operator` with the summary + a link to the run. Dedupes within a 7-day window.

## Local development

Run any single verifier:

```bash
./scripts/claims/check-skill-structure.sh        | jq
./scripts/claims/check-cross-links.sh            | jq
./scripts/claims/check-cron-claims.mjs           | jq
./scripts/claims/check-feature-flags.mjs         | jq
./scripts/claims/check-invariants.sh             | jq
./scripts/claims/check-metric-emission.mjs      | jq
./scripts/claims/check-skill-trigger-overlap.mjs | jq
./scripts/claims/check-rls-policy-coverage.mjs   | jq
./scripts/claims/check-env-documented.mjs        | jq
./scripts/claims/check-retention-policies.mjs   | jq
```

Run all + print the markdown summary:

```bash
./scripts/claims/run-all.sh
cat scripts/claims/.results/summary.md
```

Exit code `1` means at least one claim failed. Any non-zero warning
count still exits `0`.

## Adding a new verifier

1. Drop a script into `scripts/claims/` — bash, mjs, or ts.
2. The script MUST emit valid JSON on stdout with this shape:

   ```json
   {
     "name": "<slug-kebab>",
     "passed": <int>,
     "failed": <int>,
     "warnings": <int>,
     "findings": [
       { "severity": "fail|warn|info", "claim": "...", "detail": "...", "location": "..." }
     ]
   }
   ```

3. The script MUST exit `0` when no claim failed (warnings OK) and `1`
   when at least one claim failed.
4. Register it in the `VERIFIERS=(...)` array at the top of
   `scripts/claims/run-all.sh`.
5. If the verifier needs rules/skills/runbooks to change, also list the
   claim in the `docs/operations/claims-audit.md` table above.

### Claim ideas not yet implemented

Low-hanging extensions, ranked by effort × value:

- **`check-retention-policies`** — every entry in `lib/retention/policies.ts` corresponds to a real table + column pair; every destructive cron references a retention policy.
- **`check-anti-patterns`** — each `.cursor/rules/*.mdc` has an "Anti-patterns" section (keeps the rule a two-sided invariant, not one-sided advice).

## Relationship to existing loops

The claims audit is orthogonal to runtime verification loops:

| Loop                        | Verifies                      | When fails        |
| --------------------------- | ----------------------------- | ----------------- |
| `money-reconcile` (30 min)  | Runtime money drift           | Immediate alert   |
| `verify-audit-chain` (cron) | Runtime audit chain integrity | Immediate alert   |
| `backup-freshness` (cron)   | Runtime backup pipeline       | Immediate alert   |
| `rls-canary` (cron)         | Runtime tenant isolation      | Immediate alert   |
| `schema-drift` (CI)         | Schema vs. migrations match   | Blocks merge      |
| **`claims-audit` (weekly)** | **Docs vs. code match**       | **Weekly triage** |

Runtime loops catch production drift. The claims audit catches
_documentation_ drift — the kind that makes the AI agent answer stale
questions correctly-but-wrongly.

## Anti-patterns

- **Never commit fixes that silence a `fail` without addressing the claim.** If the runbook referenced a cron that no longer exists, either restore the cron or update the runbook — don't just remove the mention.
- **Never let weekly issues accumulate > 4 weeks.** Triage creates a forcing function; skipped triage means the audit is noise.
- **Never add verifiers that produce false positives.** A verifier that cries wolf poisons the trust of every other verifier. Filter placeholders + external paths aggressively.
- **Never raise warning threshold to silence drift.** Fix the underlying drift or delete the documentation — don't move the goal posts.

| 2026-04-20 | `check-metric-emission` verifier added. Reads emission catalog from `lib/metrics.ts` registry + direct `incCounter`/`observeHistogram`/`setGauge` literals; flags any metric backtick-cited in docs that isn't emitted. Severity promoted to `fail` when the citing doc is compliance-critical (audit-chain, money, DSAR, RLS canary, backup, legal-hold, secret-rotation). Historical docs (`execution-log.md`, `PENDING.md`, `implementation-plan.md`, `performance-baseline.md`, `REVIEW-*.md`) are skipped. Surfaced 4 real doc drifts: `legal_hold_purge_blocked_total` (wrong word order in `retention-policy.md`), `duration_ms`/`age_seconds` (ambiguous column refs, now qualified as `table.column`), `runs_total` shorthand (expanded to `rls_canary_runs_total`), and two fake example metrics in `observability.mdc` replaced with real ones.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |

| 2026-04-20 | `check-skill-trigger-overlap` verifier added. Enforces that the 11 skill descriptions form a **disjoint partition of the trigger phrase space** — no two skills can claim the same normalized trigger. Without this, agent dispatch becomes a coin-flip whenever triggers overlap. Extracts quoted phrases from each `description:` frontmatter field, normalizes (lowercase, collapse whitespace, unify `-_` to space), and fails on any key claimed by ≥ 2 skills. Short phrases (< 3 chars) are excluded to avoid flagging severity markers like `"P1"`.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |

| 2026-04-20 | `check-rls-policy-coverage` verifier added. Enforces that every table in `public` has either ≥ 1 `CREATE POLICY` or an explicit `-- @rls-policy(table_name): <justification>` marker. Closes the "RLS enabled but no policy = silent deny-all" trap created by migration 057's safety-net event trigger. The verifier masks SQL comments and string literals with same-length whitespace (preserving byte positions) so references like `'COMMENT ON TABLE public.%'` inside error strings don't register as phantom tables; reserved-word filtering rejects `in`, `as`, `if`, etc. from the ref scan. Surfaced the 6 pre-existing service-role-only tables (`backup_runs`, `rate_limit_violations`, `rls_canary_log`, `legal_holds`, `dsar_audit`, `secret_rotations`) whose deny-all posture was intentional but undocumented; migration 058 formalizes their intent via the marker + `COMMENT ON TABLE` so the distinction survives into the running database (visible in `\d+` and dashboards). Adversarial test: injecting a policy-less table produces a clear fail pointing at the drift source.

| 2026-04-20 | `check-env-documented` verifier added. Scans the repo for every `process.env.X` read and cross-references it against `.env.example`: **fail** when a production path (`app/`, `lib/`, `middleware.ts`, `next.config.ts`, `components/`, `services/`, `hooks/`, `types/`) reads a var that isn't templated, **warn** when only scripts/tests reference it, **warn** when `.env.example` has a stale entry nothing reads. Supports `# @env-exempt: VAR — reason` for vars that are intentionally undocumented because they're platform-injected (Vercel runtime, Stryker, CI secrets) or consumed by CLI tooling outside app code. Closes a long-standing onboarding foot-gun: before this pass, `.env.example` listed 16 vars while the code read 81, meaning a fresh clone could boot and then silently degrade (Firebase push silent, Upstash rate-limit silent, Sentry silent, OpenAI OCR silent, Zenvia SMS silent, etc.). Also cleaned two stale entries (`NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_NAME` in `.env.example`/`DEPLOY.md`/`go-live-checklist.md` — nothing in code reads it; `GOOGLE_CLIENT_*` commented-out block — removed since OAuth isn't in scope).

| 2026-04-20 | `check-retention-policies` verifier added. Cross-references every entry in `lib/retention/policies.ts` (both `RETENTION_CATALOG` and `RETENTION_EXCLUDED_TABLES`) against three ground-truth surfaces: (a) `CREATE TABLE public.X` in `supabase/migrations/` — catalog can't cite phantom tables; (b) `app/api/cron/X/route.ts` existence — policy can't name a cron that isn't deployed; (c) shallow one-level import graph of the cron's code — each cron must textually reference every table it's claimed to enforce (catches silent drift where, e.g., `purge-server-logs` stops deleting `cron_runs`). Reverse check: every cron whose name matches `purge-*` or `enforce-retention` must be named by ≥ 1 policy (prevents "silent purge jobs" shipped without a catalog update). Surfaced **7 real drifts** in the existing catalog: RP-06 cited `prescriptions` (actual: `order_item_prescriptions`), RP-12 cited `notification_outbox` (phantom — provider logs live in `server_logs`), RP-19 cited `document_reviews` (actual: `registration_requests`), and four phantom exclusions (`schema_migrations` [wrong schema], `rls_canary_results` [actual: `rls_canary_log`], `webhook_deliveries` [actual: `webhook_events`], `prescription_advances` [never existed]). Also surfaced **RP-14 enforcement drift**: policy claimed `purge-server-logs` purges `cron_runs` at 90d, but the cron only deleted `server_logs` — fixed by extending the cron to also purge `cron_runs` with non-fatal error handling + updated tests. Public `docs/legal/retention-policy.md` synced with new table names. Full audit: 10 verifiers · 1008 passing · 0 fails · 0 warnings. |
